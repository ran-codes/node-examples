## Primer to Node.js Architecture

> Node.js is a **runtime environment** for executing JavaScript code

Before Node, JS was only runned in the browser via a JS engine which converts JS to code that a machine understand. Every browser uses a different engine (e.g. Microsoft edge uses Chakra and Google chrome uses v8). Node was created in 2009 and is essentially the v8 JS engine rewritten as a C++ that can run on a computer and provides not only a JS engine but also environment objects for a runtime environement; it also provides utilities not available to browsers (such as file/path management) which allows Node to be used as a server language.

**JavaScript code is gasline. V8 is a engine. Node is a car.**
